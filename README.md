# Web-test

This repository contains a test project to a frontend developer role. This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Setup

1. To run this project, first you should install all dependencies:

 `yarn` or `npm install`

 2. To start the project:

 `yarn start` or `npm start`

  3. Server will be available at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) 
  
The page will reload if you make edits.

You will also see any lint errors in the console.

## Testing

The project tests were powered by react-testing-library and jest.

 1. To run the tests use the following command:
 `yarn test` or `npm test`
  
## What I would like to have been done

- Write more tests to increase project coverage
- Make sure the project runs fine in all browsers (cross-browser) such as Safari, Opera, Edge, etc
- Include a docker file
- Improve responsible screens such as tablet and mobile
- Created a generic form component
- Improve error handler function to fail after some tries
- Included more CSS animations on changing DOM elements
- Configure webpack.config to resolve SASS global imports
- Create a toast notification and a loader component (used third-party libraries)
- I would like to not use create-react-app to be able to customize my own bundler freely

## Feedback

- The project is very big in my opinion, it costed my whole weekend >:(
- The design from github is different from Zeplin in some cases, like the form screen, the items list and the sidebar were not matching. Due to that my project is kinda a fusion of both.
- Missing the backend and endpoints documentation.
- API was not working 100% (maybe intentional) but kinda difficult to handle and understand the behavior.
- File uploading was specified as an URL but was not mentioned where to upload the file
- Some icons are only available on FontAwesomePro and I don't have money T-T (that's why I'm applying to this job)  *joking*
